# Text-Line-Extraction-Using-Seam-Carving
Python implementtion of an Algorithm that computes robust separating seam lines that do not cut through words and line components using energy matrices of the image, which helps to compute individual lines of manuscripts.

The Program makes use of Dynamic Programming to Calculate the minimum energy path across the array of the image to calculate seam lines which have the minimum energy.

## Libraries Used:
1. Matplotlib
2. Numpy
3. Pillow
